# Jabber_contacts
Script used to take the CSVs from Jabber to build contact lists for other users

With Jabber we needed a way to build default contact lists for new people so this is how I did it. I would I take the list of contacts and the list of users and then run them through this program which would give me the CSV to upload to the Cisco IM Server and give everyone their contacts.
